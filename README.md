You can find the complete Firmware source code in the [skull-firmware](skull-firmware/) directory.

A [precompiled HEX file](skull-firmware.hex) is available too (with dummy flags, of course).
For detailed instructions how to flash the firmware yourself, check out the [reprogramming guide](https://skullctf.com/reprogramming).
